# Logistic Regression using WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn dataset from Kaggle.
This repo contains the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn dataset from Kaggle and the various models used to interpret it.

This repo covers Python programming using logistic regression models that we created to interpret the 'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churndataset and it in the "Logistic_regression.ipynb"
